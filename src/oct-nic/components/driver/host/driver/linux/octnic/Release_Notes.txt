Linux NIC Driver for OCTEON (Version 2.2.0)
===========================================

 The NIC package requires OCTEON-PCI-BASE version 2.2.0 to be installed.

 The NIC driver is available as a linux kernel loadable module that uses
 the features provided by the base driver. The base driver is available from
 the OCTEON-PCI-BASE RPM package.

 * Added support for gather in Tx (NETIF_F_SG).
 * Added support for CN56XX NIC 10E card.
 * Fixes in NIC transmit path to handle backpressure and correct handling
   if packets have to be dropped.
 * EtherPCI now enables 4 devices by default (previously 2).
 * Support for CN38XX is included but deprecated.
 * 2.4.x kernel versions are no longer supported.



 

 Release 1.0.0
 =============
 * Added support for CN56XX Pass2.1
 * Support added for all 32 packet i/o ports now.
 * Jumbo frames upto 9000 bytes supported.

Linux Driver for Octeon (CNTQ Module - Version 2.2.0)
=======================================================


 The CNTQ package requires OCTEON-PCI-BASE version 2.2.0 to be installed.

 The CNTQ driver is available as a linux kernel loadable module that uses
 the features provided by the base driver. The base driver is available from
 the OCTEON-PCI-BASE RPM package.

* General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) bus.

Properties:
- compatible: "cavium,octeon-3860-gpio"

  Compatibility with all cn3XXX, cn5XXX and cn6XXX SOCs.

- reg: The base address of the GPIO unit's register bank.

- gpio-controller: This is a GPIO controller.

- #gpio-cells: Must be <2>.  The first cell is the GPIO pin.

- interrupt-controller: The GPIO controller is also an interrupt
  controller, any of its pins may be configured as an interrupt
  source.

- #interrupt-cells: Must be <2>.  The first cell is the GPIO pin
   connected to the interrupt source.  The second cell is the interrupt
   triggering protocol and may have one of four values:
   1 - edge triggered on the rising edge.
   2 - edge triggered on the falling edge
   4 - level triggered active high.
   8 - level triggered active low.

- interrupts: Interrupt routing for pin 0.  The remaining pins are
  also routed, but in a manner that can be derived from the pin0
  routing, so they are not specified.

Example:

	gpio-controller@1070000000800 {
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		compatible = "cavium,octeon-3860-gpio";
		reg = <0x10700 0x00000800 0x0 0x100>;
		gpio-controller;
		/* Interrupts are specified by two parts:
		 * 1) GPIO pin number (0..15)
		 * 2) Triggering (1 - edge rising
		 *		  2 - edge falling
		 *		  4 - level active high
		 *		  8 - level active low)
		 */
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
		/* The GPIO pin connect to 16 consecutive CUI bits */
		interrupts = <0 16>;
	};
